## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark electric blue (#7DF9FF) to evoke a high-tech, digital feel.
- Background color: Very dark grayish-blue (#101820) for a 'dark hacking type' platform appearance.
- Accent color: Neon cyan (#40E0D0) for interactive elements, progress bars, and call-to-action buttons to stand out against the dark background.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines, and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text, which complements the high-tech aesthetic and maintains readability.
- Use minimalistic, neon-colored icons representing each service type to align with the dark and tech-focused theme.
- Design a full-screen layout with clear sections for service selection, data input, progress display, and voucher details.
- Implement subtle animations like a loading spinner or progress bar transitions to enhance user engagement without being distracting.
